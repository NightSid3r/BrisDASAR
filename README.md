This is the private working repository for the Bristol Drone Assisted Search and Rescue research projects. Access to this repository will be granted to those students who are directly working on this project. Documentation for each module of the repository will be created and maintained.

### Overview

The Bristol Drone Assisted Search and Rescue Tool is the product of research projects. It represents a combined tool designed to predict lost person behaviour, apply search algorithms to determine the "best" route for a drone, and send commands to control a drone to fly along the proposed search route.
